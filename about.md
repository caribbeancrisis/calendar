<p class="message">This calendar emerged from conversations among a range of Caribbean scholars, librarians, and activists in the New York and New Jersey areas. It is also linked to several projects, including the Unpayable Working Group at Columbia University. If you would like to contribute an event please write to <a href="mailto:bikbaporub@aol.com">Frances Negr√≥n</a> and <a href="mailto:agil@columbia.edu">Alex Gil</a>.</p>
